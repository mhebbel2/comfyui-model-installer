# ComfyUI model installer

Simple script to facilitate quick downloading of models for comfyui.

Although you probably don't need this for local single deployments, the accompanying vast ai helper script allows usage on newly created remote machines. 


## Requirements 

Runs on linux (tested debian/bash).

If you want to use the remote vast ai uploading feature
you need to install vastai CLI:

https://cloud.vast.ai/cli/

and get an API key and login the cli.
